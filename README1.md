# Next Feature & UX Enhancement Roadmap

## 1. Recurring Transactions & Automated Scheduling

Add a system that recognizes repeating expenses (rent, subscriptions) and lets users schedule future entries automatically.

- Implementation Plan
  - Analyze past transactions for consistent patterns in amount, category, and interval.
  - Build a ‚ÄúManage Recurring‚Äù UI where users confirm suggested recurrences or create new ones.
  - Store recurrence rules in localStorage with next-due dates and auto-generate entries on load.
  - Notify users via an in-app banner or browser notification when a scheduled transaction is created.

- UX Impact
  - Reduces manual data entry for predictable expenses.
  - Keeps budgets up to date without extra user effort.
  - Increases stickiness by surfacing timely reminders.

## 2. Goal-Based Budgeting & Alerts

Help users set spending goals per category or overall, then surface real-time feedback and warnings.

- Implementation Plan
  - Extend the state model to accept target values and date ranges.
  - Add a ‚ÄúBudget Goals‚Äù panel where users define limits and timeframes.
  - Hook into the chart module to overlay goal lines and change bar colors when thresholds approach or exceed.

- Implementation Plan
  - Bundle a small decision-tree or naive-Bayes model in JavaScript (e.g., Brain.js or a custom script).
  - On each user re-categorization, feed the transaction‚Äôs description, amount, and date into the training set.
  - At import/parsing time, use the trained model to suggest a category with a confidence score.
  - Display suggested tags with a ‚Äú‚úî‚Äù or ‚Äú‚úé‚Äù UI allowing fast accept or override.

- UX Impact
  - After a brief training period, cuts manual tagging by 60‚Äì80%.
  - Builds trust as suggestions steadily improve.
  - Feels personalized and intelligent.
